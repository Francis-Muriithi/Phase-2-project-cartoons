# My Cartoons
# Project Description

This is a project designed to help ease access to age-appropriate and locally available cartoons for Kids. The applictaion runs on a locally developed database of cartons that are popular and that likely to be accessed from Youtube. In the application, there is a description of the cartoon, the main subject matter of the watch and the various other attributes that can guide a user on whether to watch or not to watch the show. There is also a link directly to the Youtube channel where the particular cartoon is available, and a very elaborate and enticing image of the cartoon poster on the first page of the app.
